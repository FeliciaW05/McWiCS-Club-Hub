          "description": "The McGill Table Tennis Club aims to increase exposure for the sport of table tennis in the McGill community as well as foster a friendly, yet competitive environment for players of all skill levels to improve at the sport. We host practice sessions once a week where you can drop-in whenever you have time and either play with friends or seek guidance from one of our practice coordinators who can help you improve. We host an internal tournament every semester and tryouts in the fall. Through the fall tryouts, the strongest players are selected to comprise a woman’s and co-ed team that are sent to represent McGill at NCTTA (National Collegiate Table Tennis Association) tournaments, competing with over 150 universities across North America. Lastly, we aim for a sense of community. This is achieved through our numerous social events each year that bring people together to play table tennis or other activities in a more casual setting.

With a network of over 50 chapters in universities across North America, MEDLIFE continues to grow. The McGill chapter, the first in Canada, was founded in 2010 giving Canadian students the opportunity to participate. We currently operate in Ecuador and Peru and hope to expand our reach in the near future. All 50+ chapters send several groups of students each year to areas most in need. These teams, called Service Learning Trips, work to establish a permanent MEDLIFE presence. Whether it’s building fully staffed medical clinics or schools, or the installment of absent necessities such as clean-water wells and staircases, we continue to serve a community until we feel we have done all we can. Our long-term mission is to help families achieve freedom from the constraints of poverty, empowering them to live healthier lives. When not abroad, members can help at home through fundraising efforts. All donations are put towards the MEDLIFE Fund, and 100% of proceeds are used for the creation of medical clinics, schools, and other development projects specific to the needs of each community. By providing students with real-life, hands-on experience working with poor and underserved populations, we create socially conscious global citizens who realize the difference they as an individual can make. Like or contact us if you feel the call to action and want to make a permanent impact with MEDLIFE.",

Our main goal is to provide a space for McGill students to discover and expand their love for fashion—a space in which all personal styles are considered valid. We are also working to legitimize fashion as a field of interest and of study—it is both an important form of self-expression and a reflection of the context in which it exists. With trends often being recycled albeit modernized, fashion truly moves in a circle. Our departments span media, blog, magazine, and more. With numerous events being held each academic year, there is really something for everyone, and no way too small to get involved. We hope you will join us in growing the circle!",

Effusion performs at events, soirees, dinners, festivals, and student functions in and around Montreal, QC. The group has competed in many renowned competitions such as the International Competitions of Collegiate A Cappella and the Montreal Chinese Community and Cultural Center’s Making the Band ’09, in which we placed 2nd in the ’09 Northeast division and first overall. Music sans instruments is our passion, and we draw our influences from across the musical spectrum. R&B, soul, gospel, pop, folk, rock, and jazz influences can all be heard in our repertoire.",

At SoMM McGill, this primarily means providing free music lessons for students at English-speaking Montreal elementary schools that would otherwise have limited access to music education. McGill students can volunteer as teachers, who help a student learn to play their instrument, or with one of our logistics teams, which assist in event planning, fundraising, finances, administration, and other SoMM operations. You do not have to be a formally trained musician to teach, and speaking French is not required. Fall 2022 will be our 15th semester to offer music lessons, and we hope that you can join us!! Feel free to reach out by email or visit our website if you have any questions or want to be a member of the SoMM team.",

Composed of students in almost every faculty at McGill, Tonal Ecstasy’s members are incredibly talented when they perform individually, however, when they come together to perform as a group, their bond and collective love of music shines through their music. More than just being a joy to listen to, a TX performance is vibrant and energetic, and as much fun to watch. Although TX’s alumni are scattered around the world, they remain committed to and involved with the group. Whether they are creating arrangements for TX to perform, or travelling across the country for TX’s 20th anniversary (where over 40 alumni were present!), the alumni play a major role in helping TX be McGill’s greatest a cappella group.",

We continue to exist on stolen land from murdered indigenous peoples, and we continue the theft along with the murder. Canada went on to suppress other minorities (any list would oversimplify) much of which continues today. This reality necessitates that we study the topic, review our history, to attempt understand today, and to prepare for tomorrow. As Heschel said “We are not all guilty, but we are all responsible.” In this contemporary review, we hope to better comprehend the past and the present from our current standpoint. The topics are broad and can only be understood with serious analysis of its different embodiments. It is possible that, given the constantly changing abuses, a study of genocides and political violence will never be complete. As such, we nonetheless hope to make a small contribution to a global exchange.",

In the face of dwindling employment prospects in both academia and industry, management consulting offers an exciting career opportunity for graduate students who wish to apply their analytical and critical thinking skills to achieve a real-world impact. With this in mind, we created the McGill Graduate Management Consulting Association (McGill GMCA). Our goal is to provide exceptional graduate students and post-doctoral trainees with the training and resources necessary to enter and to excel in the competitive world of management consulting. Throughout the year, we will offer a number of events, including consulting firm information sessions, educational training sessions, case workshops led by consultants from Montreal’s top firms, networking opportunities, as well as various opportunities to test and improve your skills in case competitions!",

Meetings take place on a weekly basis at the Newman Centre of McGill University. Our club is very people-oriented, so not only do we go to dinner together on a weekly basis after our meetings, but we also offer various social activities throughout the semester in order to promote fellowship and introduce a fun side to spirituality.

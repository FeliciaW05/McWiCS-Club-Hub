Through participation in the Club’s karate trainings, students will work to improve and maintain their physical fitness by performing cardiovascular, endurance and other different types of exercises. Our members will benefit from other positive impacts of exercise such as reducing stress and gaining self-confidence.",

All four teams compete in the Canadian University Ultimate Championships in the fall and the A teams compete in the USA Ultimate College Series in the spring. The A teams are highly competitive and consistently place in the top 5 of Canada. The B teams are more developmental and comprised of players with less experience or those who would prefer a less competitive atmosphere. All members become part of a tight-knit community that hosts several events throughout the year, including an end-of-season banquet that recognizes the hard work and achievement of our members. Follow our social media for tryout announcements, updates on our teams, and fundraising initiatives!",

In the Fall of 2006, a few students shared Right To Play’s belief in harnessing the power of sport for development and peace around the world and since becoming established we have developed into a successful and popular club at McGill. We plan athletic as well as social events in order to raise money for the international Right To Play organization and to expose the McGill community to a worthy cause. Not only are we aiming to raise more funds for Right To Play, but we are also striving to create a greater sense of awareness for the organization at McGill and strengthen our network by expanding into the Montreal community.",

Canada has one of the highest prevalence rates of MS, which mostly affects the young adult demographic. This same age group is the one that is found in the McGill student community. Currently, there are very few associations that raise awareness for this prevalent disease. For this reason, SAMS aims to increase awareness and fundraising for Multiple Sclerosis through various events and programs.",

    "description": "MEDLIFE is a non-profit student organization that was established with a view towards alleviating global poverty through the distribution and promotion of Medicine, Education, and Development. With a network of over 50 chapters in universities across North America, MEDLIFE continues to grow. The McGill chapter, the first in Canada, was founded in 2010 giving Canadian students the opportunity to participate. We currently operate in Ecuador and Peru and hope to expand our reach in the near future. All 50+ chapters send several groups of students each year to areas most in need. These teams, called Service Learning Trips, work to establish a permanent MEDLIFE presence. Whether it’s building fully staffed medical clinics or schools, or the installment of absent necessities such as clean-water wells and staircases, we continue to serve a community until we feel we have done all we can. Our long-term mission is to help families achieve freedom from the constraints of poverty, empowering them to live healthier lives. When not abroad, members can help at home through fundraising efforts. All donations are put towards the MEDLIFE Fund, and 100% of proceeds are used for the creation of medical clinics, schools, and other development projects specific to the needs of each community. By providing students with real-life, hands-on experience working with poor and underserved populations, we create socially conscious global citizens who realize the difference they as an individual can make. Like or contact us if you feel the call to action and want to make a permanent impact with MEDLIFE.",

We are also working to legitimize fashion as a field of interest and of study—it is both an important form of self-expression and a reflection of the context in which it exists. With trends often being recycled albeit modernized, fashion truly moves in a circle. Our departments span media, blog, magazine, and more. With numerous events being held each academic year, there is really something for everyone, and no way too small to get involved. We hope you will join us in growing the circle!",

Effusion performs at events, soirees, dinners, festivals, and student functions in and around Montreal, QC. The group has competed in many renowned competitions such as the International Competitions of Collegiate A Cappella and the Montreal Chinese Community and Cultural Center’s Making the Band ’09, in which we placed 2nd in the ’09 Northeast division and first overall. Music sans instruments is our passion, and we draw our influences from across the musical spectrum. R&B, soul, gospel, pop, folk, rock, and jazz influences can all be heard in our repertoire.

    "description": "One of the largest student groups on the McGill campus, the McGill Choral Society gives members of the University community the chance to explore and enjoy making music together. Each year, we perform two major classical choral works accompanied by a small orchestra and professional soloists. Our audiences range from 500 to 1000 people! In the second half of our concerts, we perform a selection of seasonal and popular music. There are no auditions and sight-reading skills are not required, but all are encouraged to give their heart and voice to the joy of making music. Through benefit concerts, the choir has raised significant funds for groups such as the McGill Aids Centre, the Farha Foundation, Sun Youth and the McGill Assault Centre, and to support research into Lou Gehrig’s disease and lymphedema.",

If you are a more experienced dancer, we also hold auditions each semester for our Executive team. Dancers of all styles are always welcome! The Exec team is responsible for choreographing and leading each class, in addition to behind the scenes planning. Outside of the Exec team, the club is open to anyone… no auditions! If you are looking for a recreational club where you can stay fit, make friends and just dance, then RDC is for you!",

At SoMM McGill, this primarily means providing free music lessons for students at English-speaking Montreal elementary schools that would otherwise have limited access to music education. McGill students can volunteer as teachers, who help a student learn to play their instrument, or with one of our logistics teams, which assist in event planning, fundraising, finances, administration, and other SoMM operations. You do not have to be a formally trained musician to teach, and speaking French is not required. Fall 2022 will be our 15th semester to offer music lessons, and we hope that you can join us!! Feel free to reach out by email or visit our website if you have any questions or want to be a member of the SoMM team. Instagram LinkedIn",

Composed of students in almost every faculty at McGill, Tonal Ecstasy’s members are incredibly talented when they perform individually, however, when they come together to perform as a group, their bond and collective love of music shines through their music. More than just being a joy to listen to, a TX performance is vibrant and energetic, and as much fun to watch. Although TX’s alumni are scattered around the world, they remain committed to and involved with the group. Whether they are creating arrangements for TX to perform, or travelling across the country for TX’s 20th anniversary (where over 40 alumni were present!), the alumni play a major role in helping TX be McGill’s greatest a cappella group.

    "description": "Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM) is a global network of students that fight to make life-saving medicines affordable and accessible for all. Since universities develop many of the medical technologies that end up in the hands of pharmaceutical companies, students have the power to encourage universities to adopt equitable licensing practices. Throughout the years, our student chapter has been working on promoting the adoption of open science practices across our university, promoting world-wide access to essential medicines and vaccines and on advocating for more transparency around clinical trials. We are also very proud to be one of the main UAEM chapters working on the organization-wide Canadian Report Card project.",

We have lots of exciting projects and events planned, and we’re always looking for innovative + compassionate individuals to join the cause! Our priorities include: evidence-based support groups for students with behavioural and substance addictions, and curriculum changes for relevant programs (e.g. medicine, nursing, social work).

We continue to exist on stolen land from murdered indigenous peoples, and we continue the theft along with the murder. Canada went on to suppress other minorities (any list would oversimplify) much of which continues today. This reality necessitates that we study the topic, review our history, to attempt understand today, and to prepare for tomorrow. As Heschel said “We are not all guilty, but we are all responsible.” In this contemporary review, we hope to better comprehend the past and the present from our current standpoint. The topics are broad and can only be understood with serious analysis of its different embodiments. It is possible that, given the constantly changing abuses, a study of genocides and political violence will never be complete. As such, we nonetheless hope to make a small contribution to a global exchange.",

With a mission centred around three pillars – Connect, Inspire & Educate – the MSES aims to intervene in the early stages of student/youth entrepreneurship –namely the consideration and planning phases – as the first resource for McGillians and Montrealers to get inspired, share, learn, and discuss entrepreneurship. We bring threefold value: we foster a community of students from all faculties dedicated to excellence and impact, offer unparalleled educational/career opportunities, and inspire by sharing success/alum stories. We have three tiers of students currently involved in our society, and these are all cross-faculty, diverse groups of students: members, associates, and executives. Please reach out to learn more!

    "description": "In the past, entering the competitive world of management consulting had been the exclusive privilege of business school graduates. However consulting firms have recently started recruiting Ph.D.s in order to increase their depth of expertise in various specialized industries. In the face of dwindling employment prospects in both academia and industry, management consulting offers an exciting career opportunity for graduate students who wish to apply their analytical and critical thinking skills to achieve a real-world impact. With this in mind, we created the McGill Graduate Management Consulting Association (McGill GMCA). Our goal is to provide exceptional graduate students and post-doctoral trainees with the training and resources necessary to enter and to excel in the competitive world of management consulting. Throughout the year, we will offer a number of events, including consulting firm information sessions, educational training sessions, case workshops led by consultants from Montreal’s top firms, networking opportunities, as well as various opportunities to test and improve your skills in case competitions!",

This full-circle experience provides volunteers an experience to see the direct impact they can have on their community as well as in marginalized communities around the world.

We encourage people to share opinions about their faith and develop enlightening discussions. We hope that through this, people learn more about the Christian faith, if they wish to do so. Meetings take place on a weekly basis at the Newman Centre of McGill University. Our club is very people-oriented, so not only do we go to dinner together on a weekly basis after our meetings, but we also offer various social activities throughout the semester in order to promote fellowship and introduce a fun side to spirituality. These events bring our members together and are instrumental in harboring a spirit of friendship at ICON.",
